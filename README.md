Matlab Seismometer Testing Scripts


Usage
============

To run this code open matlab and run the program noisemainplot.m.
When you do this a GUI should open and you can select data to plot.  All the 
response and digitizer values are nominal.  The idea is to avoid making the user
create a response file.


To Do
===========

Need to link selfnoisemainplot.m with noisemainplot.m to avoid upkeeping 
both files.  

Need to add a spectral ratio program to allow for response estimates.

Need to produce better documentation.
